...........
chromecast some audio to bedroom speaker
	already proof of concepted doing this
	for now just play local music from thinkpad
javascript
	on device-new
		find device named resmed
	poll and output (time, wattage) only to file
	restart self if no resmed after a few minutes?
daemon
	eventually have crontab make sure javascript/python keeps running
	needs some windows startup thing to get the crontab running
python
	read file 
		need to avoid slowing down as file gets long
		if we just back up file once a day is that sufficient?
	if should_wakeup
		have used cpap for at least ten minutes
		after 11pm
		before 6am
		no optional at all to just not use? 
			'hey google desktop off' will in fact work...
	do wakeup
installation
